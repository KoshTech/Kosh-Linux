KoshLinux

A Linux from scratch built-in with tools written in ruby language.

Its currently in development of tool chain build system, that will be used to build a linux system it self.

Some of major changes will be implemented in init and run levels systems.

In an second redesign, I plan to redefine the linux file system, using an modern and intuitive fs layout, like GoboLinux, but I have no plans to maintain any compatibility or standards.


My modifications will includes:

- RubyInitd, a intelligent init and monitoring system

- KoshLinux package manager system, based on YML recipes to build and tar bz files for compiled packages.

- Ruby Web Interface to system admin and user preferences.

- All using SqLite to store configurations and service informations.

- And also managed by command line tools.

features: 
  - Compile source code for package from a Recipe
  - Really Simple Stupid dependency system implemented current Recipe
  - create a complete bootstrap system for compile a base system GNU
  ...

[WIP]
