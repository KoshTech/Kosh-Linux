      A Linux Distribuition with tools writen in Ruby. Can a Linux distribution be an MVC WEB application?
    </div>

    <p>A Linux from scratch built-in with tools written in ruby language.

Its currently in development of tool chain build system, that will be used to build a linux system it self.

Some of major changes will be implemented in init and run levels systems.

In an second redesign, I plan to redefine the linux file system, using an modern and intuitive fs layout, like GoboLinux, but I have no plans to maintain any compatibility or standards.
</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>You need somes packages installed on your system for start build a KoshLinux system. In a Debian/Ubuntu system, the follow line can install all necessary packages:</p>
<p>install bash binutils bison bzip2 coreutils diff gawk gcc libc6 grep gzip m4 make patch perl sed tar texinfo git ruby build-essential

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>It's simple. Just do:</p>
<p> git clone git@github.com:KoshTech/Kosh-Linux.git</p>
<p>Then cd into Build folder:</p>
<p> cd Kosh-Linux/DevelSystem/Build</p>
<p>If you want to use a development branch, do:</p>
<p> git checkout devel</p>
<p>You can use a lite script to check the Build dependence on you host machine:</p>
<p> ./check_requirements.sh</p>
<p>Look at messages generated by the script. If no errors are visible, you system is Ok to build process.</p>
<p>To start the build, run:</p>
<p> ./build_system.rb</p>

            <p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward<br>
            and may publish revised and/or new versions of this<br>
            License from time to time.  Each version will be given a<br>
            distinguishing version number.  Except as provided in<br>
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the<br>
            right to modify this License.</p>

            <b>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</b></p>
            <p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise<br>
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br>
            version of the License under which You originally received<br>
            the Covered Software.  If the Initial Developer includes a<br>
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being<br>
            distributed or otherwise made available under any<br>
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and<br>
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the<br>
            version of the License under which You originally received<br>
            the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to<br>
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software<br>
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the<br>
            License published by the license steward.</p>

            <p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to<br>
            create a new license for Your Original Software, You may<br>
            create and use a modified version of this License if You:<br>
            (a)&nbsp;rename the license and remove any references to<br>
            the name of the license steward (except to note that the<br>
            license differs from this License); and (b)&nbsp;otherwise<br>
            make it clear that the license contains terms which differ<br>
            from this License.</p>

            and all Contributors under Sections&nbsp;2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>

        <b>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b></p>
        <p>The Covered Software is a commercial item, as<br>
        that term is defined in 48&nbsp;C.F.R.&nbsp;2.101 (Oct. 1995),<br>
        consisting of commercial computer software (as<br>
        that term is defined at 48<br>
        C.F.R. &nbsp;252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial<br>
        computer software documentation as such terms are used<br>
        in 48&nbsp;C.F.R.&nbsp;12.212 (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with<br>
        48 C.F.R.  12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4<br>
        (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered<br>
        Software with only those rights set forth herein.  This<br>
        U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,<br>
        any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that<br>
        addresses Government rights in computer software under this<br>

        <b>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</b></p>
        <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning<br>
        subject matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is<br>
        held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed<br>
        only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This<br>
        License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction<br>
        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software<br>
        (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides<br>
        otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions<br>
        conflict-of-law provisions.  Any<br>
        litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the<br>
        jurisdiction of the courts located in the<br>
        jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within<br>
        the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for<br>
        costs, including, without limitation, court costs and<br>
        reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.  The<br>
        application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for<br>
        the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any<br>
        law or regulation which provides that the language of a<br>

        apply to this License.  You agree that You alone are<br>
        responsible for compliance with the United States export<br>
        administration regulations (and the export control laws and<br>
        regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or<br>
        otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>

        <b>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b></p>
        <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each<br>
        party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly<br>
        or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this<br>
        License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and<br>
        Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable<br>
        basis.  Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to<br>
        constitute any admission of liability.</p>
