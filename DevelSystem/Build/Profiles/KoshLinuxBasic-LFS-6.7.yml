#  I suggest, maybe the stage thing os packages can be one this section folling the order.
#  Ex.: 
#      * We got a build_system section which define the packages for make the stage-1 packages
#      * The base_system section maybe for the base_system, maybe the stage-2 thing
#      * With packages section we use for define like final package and installed system need.
