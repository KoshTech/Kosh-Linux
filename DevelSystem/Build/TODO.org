    - For recipe and actions use attributes: optional=yes, optional=recommended and optional=no
      - optional=yes, set the Recipe or Action for optional and only be used if requested on command line
      - optional=recommended set Recipe or Action for optional in auto mode, only build Recipe if optional command line set to auto
      - optional=no this is the default behaviour if not exist the attribute, the Recipe or Action is not optional, always build.
