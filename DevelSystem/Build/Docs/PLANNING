Is a Gnu/Linux based from Linux From Scratch with tools writen in Ruby Language,
using bash wrappers for some execute some tasks. We are learning Ruby and would 
like to make some tools for test old theories to build a GNU/Linux System. 

We has made a first stage of temporary system and working on stage two for 
build a full bootable and usable Linux System.

We have done these Recipies and its dependencies:

  - build-binutils-2.20.1
  - build-gcc-4.5.1
  - build-linux-2.6.35.4
  - build-glibc-2.12.1
  - base-binutils-2.20.1
  - base-gcc-4.5.1
  - base-tcl-8.5.8
  - base-expect-5.44.1.15
  - base-dejagnu-1.4.4
  - base-ncurses-5.7
  - base-bash-4.1
  - base-bzip2-1.0.5
  - base-coreutils-8.5
  - base-diffutils-3.0
  - base-file-5.04


We are working to create last recipes for complete the build of temporary system. 

Do a linux_package.rb refactoring. 

Do a chroot and follow the LSF book


Migrate all Recipe system from YML based file to a pure Ruby Language based 
recipes.
