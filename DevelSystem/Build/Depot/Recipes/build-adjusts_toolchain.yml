  description: "The cross-compiler's specs file needs to be adjusted to point to the new dynamic linker in /tools. This is done by dumping the compiler's “specs” file to a location where it will look for it by default. A simple sed substitution then alters the dynamic linker that GCC will use. The principle here is to find all references to the dynamic linker file in /lib or possibly /lib64 if the host system is 64-bit capable, and adjust them to point to the new location in /tools."
